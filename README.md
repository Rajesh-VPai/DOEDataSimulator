# DOEDataSimulator
DOESimulator is an advanced Simulator where hypothetical or “near theory” AND/OR Randomised Result Values of the DOE Experiment are generated. The Simulator data file can be fed to the DOEOFATAnalyzer and the DOERegression Software to analyse as well as generate the equation that guide the natural / machine process that is being studied.
# Packages
